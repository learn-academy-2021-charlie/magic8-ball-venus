# Magic 8 Ball Challenge

In this activity we're going to create a Magic 8 Ball application. We'll use a React application as a template to run the code that we are going to write for Magic 8 Ball.


### Magic 8 Ball Stories
- As a user, I can type in a question to the magic 8 ball application.
- As a user, when I click submit, I see a random answer displayed.
- As a user, the page is styled, and pleasing to use.

### Getting started

All the code you'll need to write for this app is going to be inside one function in the `/src/App.js` file.

After you accept the assignment and clone this repo, you'll want to install all the node modules using `yarn`.

```bash
$ cd magic8-ball-challenge
$ yarn
```

Then you are ready to start a server to run the application:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Now you're ready to code!

Get started by finding the `handleSubmit` method, and write your code. Every time you save your updated file, the browser window displaying your app will reload.
